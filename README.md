# Data_transformation_using_pandas
This analysis of salaries based on rank, discipline, phd, service, sex is present in the repository. Data transformation techniques like
Creating columns (default and calculated), concatenating, Appending, Renaming, and Reording in Python.

## Getting Started

##Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system

## Installing
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/karthik-surapparaju/Data_transformation_using_pandas.git

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. To access the project directory, open the terminal and navigate there.

2. Execute the subsequent command to launch the software:
main.py in Python

3. Launch a web browser and open the application by going to http://localhost:8080.

## Contents

The Python code for Creating columns (default and calculated), concatenating, Appending, Renaming, and Re-ordering in Python 
is contained in the Jupyter Notebook file Data_transformation_using_pandas.ipynb.
The Salaies dataset is contained in the CSV file Salaries.csv. 

## Dataset Overview

The Salaries dataset consists of the following columns:

- `rank`: Rank of the employee
- `discipline`: Category of the discipline
- `phd`: phd numbers
- `service`: service numbers
- `sex`: Gender category
- `salary`: Salary of the employee
  
## Summary of Analysis
The CSV file is read into a pandas DataFrame using the Python code.
It performs many data transformation methods used for Creating columns (default and calculated), concatenating, Appending, 
Renaming and Reording and using group by, when and where functions in Python using various pandas functions.

# Deployment
Make sure you have installed the relevant libraries and have set up the proper Python environment before deploying this data summarizing method. After that, you may utilize this script in your environment or project by doing the following:

1. Check to see if Python is installed.
2. If the required libraries (pandas) are not already installed, use pip install pandas to install them.
3. Verify that the CSV file (Salaries.csv) is in the same directory as your script, or provide the correct path to the file by using the pd.read_csv() function.
4. Copy and paste the provided code into your Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
5. Start the script or notepad.
6. This is going to read the CSV file, correct the data types, then perform data transformations like Creating columns (default and calculated), concatenating, Appending, 
Renaming and Reording and using group by, when and where functions

## Tests
Verify that the dataframe has been loaded properly. 
Verify that the data types have been transformed as anticipated. 
Check the dataframe's initial few rows for accuracy.
